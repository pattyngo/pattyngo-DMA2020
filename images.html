                  <h4>Title: Inner Garden <br>Medium: Digital Art<br>Dimensions: 897×1121<br>An assignment I had in ART 3 prompted us to create a self-portrait using a collage of images that best represent us.  I chose to use various images of flowers since plants bring me the most joy and I was able to get a broad range of hues and textures using these patterns. I archived this image by breaking down my original self-portrait into highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. I used these groups of colors to create masks that would allow me to layer on each image in specific shapes that would create my face. This whole project was very experimental and challenged me to come up with my own methods></h4>

                  <h4>Title: Through the City<br><br>Medium: Photography, Digital Art<br>Dimensions: 750x750<br>The theme of my AP art portfolio was to distort photos using geometry. I created a series of images that used shapes to change the way each photo was interpreted. This was one of mys tronger pieces since the lines lead the eye around the image. The black and white image in the back has a range of tones and textures and I tried to complement that with the pop of color. When I use photography in my artwork, I try to have as much contrast as possible to have a dramatic effect. </h4>

                    <h4>Title: Patty in Wonderland<br>Medium: Photography, Digital Art<br>Dimensions: 2010×2880<br>This is a self-portrait placing myself in a fantasy setting inspired by the movies Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz. I created this image in response to being quarantined and wanting to be out exploring the world. During times of social isolation, it is important to look after yourself and make yourself feel valuable. Creating art for yourself is a form of self-love. By incorporating things that I enjoy the most into my artwork, I create something that represents my happy place. </h4>

                    <h4>Title: Clean Beach Initiative<br>Medium: Digital Art<br>Dimensions: 1200x900<br>In ART 2, we were tasked to create an art piece that would be used as a PSA. Since environmental conservation is an important topic for me, I wanted to advocate for keeping our beaches clean. I made this illustration of what our beaches are looking like now compared to what they could look like if everyone cleaned up after ourselves. My intention is to have this image posted on signs all around some beaches as a visual reminder for people to pick up their trash. The phrase “Initiating a cleaner world” is the motto of the Clean Beach Initiative which is an organization that focuses on doing beach cleanups. </h4>

                      <h4>Title: Blossom<br>Medium: Photography, Animation<br>Dimensions: 650x650<br>The Mandala Project is a project that represents unity and delivery through art. When participating in this project, I learned that each layer of a mandala can have its own meaning. When you think about what you can put into a mandala, the possibilities are endless. This is what I enjoy the most about mandala art. When I used the layers of a mandala and put it into an animation, I made a meditative art piece that reminds me to take a deep breath and destress myself. This animation was created using Photoshop and After Effects. </h4>

I loved double exposure so much that I ended up making my entire Scholastic art portfolio full of double exposure images. This image was by far my favorite artpiece that I created for that set of photos. The boy in the picture is my friend Allen, who I would always go out on spontaneous trips to the city with to go get boba. Allen is an adventurer as well as a huge foodie, so this image captures all his best qualities. This image received a Siver Key from the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.</h4>
