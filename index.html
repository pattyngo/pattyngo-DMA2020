      <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
      <p>My name is Patty and I am a digital media artist that creates whimsical, eye-catching artwork that includes themes of nature. The concepts for my artwork are very broad and imaginative. I want to give the viewer the experience of stepping into a whole new world. I prefer to challenge myself to try new things in my art so no idea will ever be too difficult for me. I would rather do something that is out of my comfort zone as this allows me to constantly grow as an artist. I have almost 10 years of art education which has given me a plethora of experience with different techniques and styles. Although my usual medium is digital, I also produce many physical artworks in the form of paintings or sculptures. I tend to be extremely detail-oriented and I pride myself on having pixel-perfect accuracy. Producing quality art in a time-efficient manner is important to me. The intention of my artwork is to simply make the viewer feel happier. I keep the subjects of my artwork light-hearted because I never want anyone to feel negative emotions when they look at something I created. If I can make someone smile or laugh, that makes me feel like a better artist.
