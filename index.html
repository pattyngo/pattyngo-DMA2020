      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <div class="a">
      <p>My name is Patty and I am a digital media artist that creates whimsical, eye-catching artwork that includes themes of nature. The concepts for my artwork are very broad and imaginative. I want to give the viewer the experience of stepping into a whole new world. I prefer to challenge myself to try new things in my art so no idea will ever be too difficult for me. I would rather do something that is out of my comfort zone as this allows me to constantly grow as an artist.

        Creating art has always been something that was important to me. I wasn’t until high school when I realized that art was my one main passion. I enrolled in a media arts program within my school called Media Communications Academy. Being in this academy pushed me to constantly try out new techniques. I learned that anything I want to create is achievable as long as I had the drive to complete the task. In September 2017 became the president of this academy and my goal was to inspire other students to consider making media arts their passion. I had such a good experience learning about media art and I wanted to take all the valuable knowledge I gained and expand on what I could create. This is why I chose to pursue media art after high school.

        I chose the Digital Media Arts program at San Jose State because of the great reviews I heard from some alumni. I have heard positive remarks about the faculty and resources available. After I receive my bachelor’s degree, I would like to either work in UX/UI design or pursue higher education in order to become a media arts teacher. Regardless of what career I have, I want to use my skills to help other people.
