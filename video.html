          <p>My project definitely has a silly feeling to it. I wanted to create a refreshing video. My motivation behind making this video was based off how I don't like art to always have a deep and spiritual meaning. My old high school teacher would preach that if your art did not have a strong meaning, then there is no point of making art. I think it is okay to make seemingly meaningless art. I do not like to make serious art. I just want to stray away from art that is hiding behind a complex concept.</p>

          <p>This video is a representation of how many people are currently living their lives vicariously through their Animal Crossing character. Animal Crossing has helped many people of various ages cope with being in quarantine. This game helps people feel like they are achieving something by doing small everyday tasks. I wanted to show the values of being out in nature and growing bonds with friends. I hope my video brings a smile to someone's face. </p>
